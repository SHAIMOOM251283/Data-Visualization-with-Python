# Data Visualization with Python

This project is an in-depth exploration of Part 2: Data Visualization from *Python Crash Course (Third Edition)* by Eric Matthes. It encapsulates a comprehensive dive into data visualization, leveraging object-oriented programming principles across the following chapters:
- Chapter 15: Generating Data
- Chapter 16: Downloading Data
- Chapter 17: Working with APIs

## Insights and Objectives
This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Python, divided into three core sections:
1. **Generating Data**: Generating data and creating a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using Matplotlib and Plotly.
2. **Downloading Data**: Fetching data from online sources and feeding it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a map of global earthquake activity.
3. **Working with APIs**: Interacting with web APIs to retrieve and visualize data.
